# AI-Powered SQL Chatbot ü§ñ

A conversational AI-powered chatbot that allows you to interact with a MySQL database using natural language. This project leverages the power of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model through LangChain to translate your questions into SQL queries, fetch the results, and provide answers in a human-friendly format.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simple but powerful architecture to process user requests.

```
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +---------------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
|   User (Web     |----->|   Flask Backend |----->|   LangChain         |----->|   Gemini 1.5    |----->|   SQL Database  |
|   Interface)    |      |   (app.py)      |      |   (LLM Chain)       |      |   Flash (LLM)   |      |   (MySQL)       |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +---------------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
        ^                                                                                                      |
        |                                                                                                      |
        +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                     (Natural Language Response)
```

1.  **User Input**: The user types a question in the web interface.
2.  **Flask Backend**: The Flask server receives the question.
3.  **LangChain**: LangChain constructs a detailed prompt containing the user's question, conversation history, and the database schema.
4.  **Gemini LLM**: The prompt is sent to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, which generates the appropriate SQL query.
5.  **Security Check**: The backend validates the generated SQL to ensure it's a read-only query.
6.  **Database Query**: The safe SQL query is executed against the MySQL database.
7.  **Final Response**: The query result is sent back to the LLM to generate a natural language response, which is then displayed to the user.
